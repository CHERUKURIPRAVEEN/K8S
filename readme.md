### Container Orchestration:
* Container Orchestration automates redeployment, management, scaling and networking of containers across the cluster. It is focused on managing the life cycle of containers.
* Enterprises that need to deploy and manage hundreds or thousands of Linux containers and hosts can benefit from container orchestration.
  
#### Container Orchestration is used to automate the following tasks:
1. Configuring and scheduling of containers.
2. Provisioning and deployment of containers.
3. Redundancy and availability of containers (Desired Vs Current state).
4. scaling up or remove containers to spread application load evenly across host infrastructure.
5. Movement of containers from one host to another another if there is a shortage of resources in your host or if a host dies.
6. Allocation of resources between the containers.
7. External expose of service running in a container with outside world.
8. Load balancing of the service discovery between the containers.
9. Health monitoring of the containers and host.
